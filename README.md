# ROS2-JoySubscriber-MicroROS-publisher
Proof of concept ROS2 code that reads the X button on a PS4 GamePad on the /Joy topic.
If the X button is pressed it sends a message to micro controller running on micro-ros.
When the X button is not pressed a different message is sent to the micro controller.
